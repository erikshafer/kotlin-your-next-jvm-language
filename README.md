# Kotlin: Your Next JVM Language

This is a repository of code from Erik Shafer's talk at Nebraska.Code() 2018 about JetBrain's JVM language, Kotlin.

*Slides will be published soon.*

Go to package `src/main//kotlin/p00_live_code_example` for the live code Movie example. Other snippets from the talk plus extras can be found in the `/kotlin` package.

Note the `build.gradle.kts` is written in Kotlin DSL! How cool is that?
